# frontend-projects
A collection of my front-end dev projects built from scratch
# 💻 Front-End Projects by @samsdivstudios

This repo is a hub for all the front-end projects I’m building as I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each project is either:
- In its own folder here, or
- Linked to a separate repo for bigger builds
